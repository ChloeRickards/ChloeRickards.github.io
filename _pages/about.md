# Experience

#### Graduate Student Researcher, 09/2020 – 09/2022, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* Estimated Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of COVID-19 in New York City from serology, case, and death data
* Applied Fourier transforms, Bayesian inference, and a No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) to infer undiagnosed infections and test for maximum likelihood among IFR estimates
* Assessed several IFRs across the globe for patterns in age-specific mortality and determined potential causes for the patterns observed, including wealth inequality and underlying conditions
* Findings in press, with a preprint available at: https://bit.ly/3abTiVg 

#### Postbac Student Researcher, 06/20218– 08/2020, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* Compared the lifespans and environmental persistence of 150 parasites and pathogens; found that diseases with environmental components are more difficult to control and eradicate
* Published findings available at: https://bit.ly/3c30owl 

#### Undergraduate Student Researcher, 06/2015 – 06/2018, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* Constructed a stochastic model of the population genetics of the freshwater snail responsible for transmitting schistosomiasis, a Neglected Tropical Disease and a disease of poverty 
* Projected theoretical changes to local disease burden after introducing a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene drive designed to confer resistance to the snail hosts
* Findings in press, with a preprint available at: https://bit.ly/3Mxg4oa 

#### Teaching Assistant, 09/2020 – 08/2022, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* BIOE 109: Evolution, Fall 2020
* BIOE 107: Ecology, Spring 2021
* COSMOS: Entomology, Summer 2022

#### MINT Program Mentor, 09/2021-present, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* Mentor undergraduate students in the process of applying to graduate schools
* Provide undergraduate students with opportunities to gain lab and field experience
