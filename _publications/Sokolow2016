excerpt: 'Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease infecting more than 250 million people worldwide, with almost 800 million at risk. Over the past century, nations undertook schistosomiasis control programs, with outcomes varying from little effect to elimination. The biggest hope for elimination began about 40 years ago with the discovery of the antischistosomal drug praziquantel, after which snail control was seen as old fashioned. Here, we review control program outcomes over the past 100 years across all major schistosomiasis endemic zones, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. We screened for differences in long-term schistosomiasis reductions among countries and found the most successful programs focused on transmission control (most often snail control, with or without engineering interventions), sometimes in tandem with praziquantel. Although praziquantel has important human-health benefits, our results suggest old-fashioned snail control has been the key to schistosomiasis elimination.'

# Author Summary
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease infecting more than 250 million people worldwide, with almost 800 million at risk. Over the past century, nations undertook schistosomiasis control programs, with outcomes varying from little effect to elimination. The biggest hope for elimination began about 40 years ago with the discovery of the antischistosomal drug praziquantel, after which snail control was seen as old fashioned. Here, we review control program outcomes over the past 100 years across all major schistosomiasis endemic zones, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. We screened for differences in long-term schistosomiasis reductions among countries and found the most successful programs focused on transmission control (most often snail control, with or without engineering interventions), sometimes in tandem with praziquantel. Although praziquantel has important human-health benefits, our results suggest old-fashioned snail control has been the key to schistosomiasis elimination.
